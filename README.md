### Hi there, I’m Michael 👋

I’m **Michael Böhme**, theoretical chemist 👨🏻‍🔬 and computer enthusiast 👨🏻‍💻 from **Jena 💚, Germany**. I’m currently working in part-time at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena doing scientific research in computational magnetochemistry. 🧲 You can have a look on my **[personal website](https://www.michael-böhme.de/)**, if you want to know more about my scientific work. 🧪

Besides, **I love to code** since I was 10 years old. 👦🏻 I’ve learned to program on an old **Commodore C64** 👾 with the help of the great C64 User's Guide. 📖 Nowadays, I am mostly working with C++ and Python, sometimes also MatLab, BASH scripts or gnuplot. 📈 I’m currently **learning** a lot of new features of modern **C++20** and **3D graphics programming** in general. 🌱 In my spare time 🌞, I’m working on a yet secret project of mine. 😎 Stay tuned! 🖖
